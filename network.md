The specific software used in Starlink's core network isn't publicly detailed by SpaceX, as they keep such proprietary information confidential. However, based on industry standards and the nature of Starlink's satellite-based internet service, I can provide an informed overview of the types of software likely involved and what they typically use.

### Types of Software in Starlink's Core Network
Starlink's core network manages the communication between satellites, ground stations, and user terminals. The software involved would likely include:

1. **Network Management Software**:
   - **Purpose**: Orchestrates data routing, load balancing, and network optimization across the satellite constellation and ground infrastructure.
   - **Examples**: Custom-built network management systems (NMS) or adapted enterprise-grade solutions like Cisco’s Network Services Orchestrator or Nokia’s Network Services Platform.
   - **Functions**: Monitors network performance, manages bandwidth allocation, and ensures low-latency handoffs between satellites and ground stations.

2. **Satellite Control Software**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages satellite operations, including orbit adjustments, attitude control, and communication protocols.
   - **Examples**: Proprietary software developed by SpaceX, possibly built on real-time operating systems (RTOS) like VxWorks or FreeRTOS, commonly used in aerospace.
   - **Functions**: Controls satellite payloads, beamforming for phased-array antennas, and inter-satellite laser links.

3. **Routing and Protocol Software**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles data packet routing across the constellation using protocols optimized for low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite networks.
   - **Examples**: Likely uses a custom implementation of IP-based protocols (e.g., IPv6) with software-defined networking (SDN) for dynamic routing.
   - **Functions**: Ensures efficient data transfer between satellites and ground stations, minimizing latency and packet loss.

4. **Ground Station Software**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages communication between satellites and ground stations, including signal processing and data forwarding.
   - **Examples**: Custom middleware or adaptations of software like GNU Radio for signal processing, paired with high-performance networking stacks.
   - **Functions**: Processes uplink/downlink signals, manages encryption, and interfaces with terrestrial internet backbones.

5. **Firmware for User Terminals**:
   - **Purpose**: Runs on Starlink dishes (user terminals) to connect to satellites and manage local network traffic.
   - **Examples**: Embedded software, likely running on a Linux-based kernel or a lightweight RTOS.
   - **Functions**: Controls antenna alignment, signal acquisition, and local Wi-Fi distribution.

### What the Software Uses
The software in Starlink’s core network likely relies on the following technologies and frameworks:

1. **Programming Languages**:
   - **C/C++**: For performance-critical components like satellite control and real-time data processing due to their speed and low-level hardware access.
   - **Python**: For scripting, automation, and network management tasks due to its flexibility and extensive libraries.
   - **Go or Rust**: For modern, scalable network services, as these languages offer memory safety and concurrency, ideal for distributed systems.
   - **JavaScript/Node.js**: Potentially for internal dashboards or user-facing interfaces.

2. **Operating Systems**:
   - **Linux**: Widely used in networking and ground station systems for its stability and open-source ecosystem.
   - **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**: Such as VxWorks or FreeRTOS for satellite onboard systems, ensuring deterministic performance for time-sensitive tasks.
   - **Embedded Systems**: User terminals likely run lightweight Linux distributions or custom firmware.

3. **Protocols and Standards**:
   - **TCP/IP and UDP**: For data transmission, with UDP likely prioritized for low-latency applications like video streaming or gaming.
   - **SDN and NFV**: Software-defined networking and network function virtualization for dynamic traffic management across the constellation.
   - **TLS/SSL**: For secure communication between satellites, ground stations, and user terminals.
   - **Custom Protocols**: SpaceX likely uses proprietary protocols optimized for LEO satellite communication, possibly extending standards like Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN).

4. **Databases and Data Processing**:
   - **Distributed Databases**: Systems like Apache Cassandra or CockroachDB for managing network state and telemetry data across distributed nodes.
   - **Time-Series Databases**: Such as InfluxDB for real-time monitoring of network performance and satellite health.
   - **Big Data Frameworks**: Tools like Apache Kafka or Spark for processing large-scale telemetry and traffic data.

5. **Cloud and Infrastructure**:
   - **Cloud Platforms**: SpaceX may use AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for ground-based processing and integration with terrestrial networks, as seen in their partnerships for Starlink enterprise services.
   - **Containerization**: Docker or Kubernetes for deploying and scaling network services across ground stations.
   - **Virtualization**: For running multiple services on shared hardware in ground stations.

6. **Security Software**:
   - **Encryption**: AES or similar for securing data in transit.
   - **Firewalls and IDS/IPS**: To protect against cyber threats, especially given speculation about cyberattacks during outages.
   - **Authentication Systems**: For secure access to network resources and user terminals.

### Why This Matters for the Outage
The July 24, 2025, outage was attributed to a failure in "key internal software services" in the core network. This likely refers to one or more of the above components—possibly the network management software or routing protocols—failing due to a configuration error, a botched update, or an unforeseen bug. For instance, a faulty update to the SDN controller or a database managing network state could disrupt traffic routing across the constellation, causing widespread service loss. The complexity of managing thousands of satellites and ground stations in real-time makes such systems prone to cascading failures if a critical service goes offline.

If you want more details on a specific component (e.g., satellite firmware or routing protocols), let me know, and I can dig deeper! Alternatively, if you have specific data about the outage or network metrics, I could help visualize it with a chart.
