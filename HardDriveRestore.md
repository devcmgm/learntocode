Recovering data from a failed Western Digital (WD) My Book external hard drive can be complex due to potential hardware encryption, physical damage, or logical issues. Below is a step-by-step guide based on best practices for diagnosing and recovering data from a failed WD My Book drive. Note that some steps involve technical processes, and if the data is critical, professional assistance may be necessary to avoid further loss.

Based on your request for recommendations on recovering a failed WD My Book hard drive, I’ll suggest specific data recovery tools and professional services tailored to common failure scenarios (logical or physical). These recommendations prioritize ease of use, effectiveness, and compatibility with WD My Book drives, including those with hardware encryption. I’ll also include guidance on contacting services for professional recovery.
If your WD My Book external hard drive is experiencing **mechanical failure** (e.g., clicking, grinding, or no spinning sounds), this indicates a physical issue with the drive’s internal components, such as the read/write heads, platters, or motor. Mechanical failures require careful handling, as continued use can worsen damage and reduce data recovery chances. Since you’ve confirmed a mechanical failure, software-based recovery like MiniTool Power Data Recovery is unlikely to work, and professional intervention is the best course of action. Below, I’ll outline steps to confirm the failure, precautions to take, and recommendations for professional data recovery services with expertise in WD My Book drives, including handling potential hardware encryption.

---

### Step 1: Confirm Mechanical Failure
1. **Verify Symptoms**:
   - **Clicking or grinding noises**: Suggests stuck or damaged read/write heads or platters.
   - **No spinning**: Indicates a seized motor or stuck spindle.
   - **Not detected**: The drive doesn’t appear in Disk Management (Windows: Right-click Start > Disk Management) or Disk Utility (Mac: Finder > Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility), even with different cables or ports.
   - **Vibration or heat**: Unusual vibrations or excessive heat can accompany mechanical issues.

2. **Test Connections**:
   - Try a different USB cable, power adapter, USB port, or computer to rule out external issues.
   - If the drive still makes abnormal noises or isn’t detected, stop using it immediately.

3. **Do Not Attempt DIY Fixes**:
   - **Avoid opening the drive**: Opening a hard drive outside a cleanroom introduces dust, which can destroy platters and make data unrecoverable.
   - **Do not freeze or tap the drive**: These outdated “fixes” can cause further damage.
   - **Stop powering the drive**: Repeated attempts to spin up can worsen mechanical damage.

4. **Encryption Note**:
   - WD My Book drives often use hardware encryption via the enclosure’s SATA-to-USB bridge chip. Even if the drive is removed from the enclosure, data may be inaccessible without the original enclosure’s circuit board. Keep the enclosure intact and provide it to professionals.

---

### Step 2: Why Software Won’t Work
Mechanical failures (e.g., damaged heads, platters, or motor) prevent the drive from functioning well enough for software like MiniTool to access it. If the drive isn’t detected or makes clicking noises, tools like MiniTool, R-Studio, or TestDisk will fail to scan or recover data. Attempting to use software in this state can stress the drive further, reducing recovery chances. Therefore, professional data recovery is the recommended approach.
