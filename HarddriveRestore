### Step 1: Diagnose the Problem
Before attempting recovery, identify the type of failure to determine the best approach:

1. **Symptoms of Failure**:
   - **Not recognized**: The drive doesn’t appear in File Explorer or Disk Management (Windows) or Finder/Disk Utility (Mac).
   - **Clicking or grinding noises**: Indicates physical damage to the drive’s mechanical components.
   - **Spontaneous disconnects/reconnects**: Could be due to a faulty cable, enclosure, or internal issue.
   - **Error messages**: Messages like “disk not initialized,” “needs to be formatted,” or “I/O error” suggest logical or hardware issues.
   - **Slow performance or freezing**: May indicate bad sectors or firmware corruption.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - **Verify connections**: Ensure the power cable, USB cable, and port are functional. Try a different USB port, cable, or computer.[](https://recoverit.wondershare.com/harddrive-recovery/wd-my-book-data-recovery.html)
   - **Listen for noises**: Clicking, grinding, or no spinning suggests physical failure. Stop using the drive immediately to avoid further damage.[](https://www.filesaversdatarecovery.com/removable-media/external-hard-drive-recovery-by-brand/western-digital-external-hard-drive-data-recovery.html)
   - **Check Disk Management (Windows)** or **Disk Utility (Mac)**:
     - Windows: Right-click Start > Disk Management. Look for the drive (e.g., “Unknown” or “Unallocated”).
     - Mac: Open Disk Utility and check if the drive appears but is unreadable.
   - **SMART status**: Use tools like WD Drive Utilities or CrystalDiskInfo to check the drive’s health. A “SMART failed” status indicates physical issues.[](https://www.tenforums.com/backup-restore/211763-help-recovering-data-wd-my-book-wdbbgb0080hbk-na.html)

3. **Note Encryption**:
   WD My Book drives often use hardware encryption via the SATA-to-USB bridge. If the enclosure’s circuit board fails, data may be inaccessible without the original encryption chip.[](https://www.tenforums.com/backup-restore/193302-best-approach-restore-recover-4tb-wd-my-book-external-hdd.html)[](https://www.filesaversdatarecovery.com/removable-media/external-hard-drive-recovery-by-brand/western-digital-external-hard-drive-data-recovery.html)

     - **TestDisk**: Free, open-source tool for partition recovery.[](https://carltonbale.com/western-digital-my-book-opening-the-case-removing-the-drive/comment-page-7/)
   - **Steps**:
     1. Download and install the software on a different drive (not the WD My Book).
     2. Connect the WD My Book to a working computer.
     3. Scan the drive for lost files or partitions.
     4. Preview and recover files to a separate storage device.
   - **Note**: If the drive is encrypted, standard software may recover raw or unreadable files unless the encryption key is bypassed.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/datarecovery/comments/16a2cfi/help_recovering_data_from_failed_wd_my_book/)

2. **Check for File System Errors**:
   - Run `chkdsk` (Windows) to fix logical errors:
     - Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
     - Type `chkdsk X: /f` (replace X with the drive letter). Do not use `/r` unless necessary, as it can be time-consuming.
     - If errors persist, avoid further writes and proceed to recovery software.[](https://www.paessler.com/help/western-digital-errors)

3. **Test on Another Computer**:
   - Connect the drive to a different computer to rule out system-specific issues (e.g., driver conflicts or USB port problems).[](https://recoverit.wondershare.com/harddrive-recovery/wd-my-book-data-recovery.html)
