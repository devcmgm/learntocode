<h2>Computers are Dumb - CPU, Operating System, System Calls, Compilers and interpreters</h2>

    <P>A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.</P>
    <LI><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">Machine Code</a></LI>

    <P>Machine code is a computer program written in machine language instructions that can be executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). </P>

    <LI><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">Operating Systems</a></LI>
<P>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.</P>
    <LI><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)">Command Line Shells</a></LI>

    <P>In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.</P>
    <LI><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">Compilers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">Interpreters</a></LI>
    <P>Compilers and interpreters. A compiler is a program that reads in as input a program (in some high-level programming language) and outputs machine language code (for some machine architecture). The machine language code can subsequently be executed any number of times using different input data each time. As an example, the Unix program g++ transforms a C++ source file into a machine executable file a.out which can be run natively on Sparc microprocessors. As a second example, the Java compiler javac transforms a .java source file into a .class file that is written in Java bytecode, which is the machine language for an imaginary machine known as the Java Virtual Machine.
        An interpreter is a program that reads in as input a source program, along with data for the program, and translates the source program instruction by instruction. For example, the Java interpreter java translate a .class file into code that can be executed natively on the underlying machine. As a second example, the program VirtualPC interprets programs written for the Intel Pentium architecture (IBM-PC clone) for the PowerPC architecture (Macintosh). This enable Macintosh users to run Windows programs on their computer.</P>
    <LI><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Virtual Machines</a></LI>
    <P>a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.</P>
    <LI><a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">Docker</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a></LI>
    <p>A fundamental difference between Kubernetes and Docker is that Kubernetes is meant to run across a cluster while Docker runs on a single node.</p>
    <LI><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">Web Servers</a></LI>
    <P>A web server is server software, or hardware dedicated to running this software, that can satisfy client requests on the World Wide Web.</P>
    <LI><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">Computer Networking</a></LI>
<P>A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes, which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.</P>
    <LI><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Web Browser</a></LI>
    <P>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web.</P>
    <LI><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework">Web Framework</a></LI>
    <P>A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs.</P>
    <LI><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud Computing</a></LI>
    <P>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. </P>
